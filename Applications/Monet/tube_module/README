HISTORY:

May 2, 1995:		Lengthened the time out for dropped messages from the
			snddriver to 6 seconds, from 3 seconds.  Reset the
			static variable "count" to 0 when switching between
			polled and infinite-wait modes in the
			await_write_done_message() function.  Hopefully, this
			fixes the pause bug.

April 19th, 1995:	When stopping the synthesizer using SSI output, the
			output DMA buffers are now set to 0, to eliminate
			repeated sound output.

April 18th, 1995:	Adjusted the median pitch scaling for SSI output
			by one bit (i.e. cut in half) to avoid overflow.

April 3rd, 1995:	Added volume scaling so that high and low voices are
			more or less even.  This scaling uses the new "median
			pitch" parameter set when specifying utterance-rate
			parameters.

March 26th, 1995:	Raised output volume another 6 dB.  Added compiler
			flag to optimize out recalculation of waveform at the
			control rate whenever tnMin and tnMax are equal.
			Optimized code by combining master volume scaling with
			the left and right stereo scaling constants.  Tube
			lengths down to 15.9 cm (the theoretical lower limit
			with the present sample rate conversion algorithm)
			are now possible on black hardware.  Cleaned up code
			and macros.

March 7th, 1995:	Now use libtool instead of ld and lipo, to create
			the FAT synthesizer_module.a.

March 3rd, 1995:	Changed the test_synth program so that a rising
			pitch sweep is produced.

March 1st, 1995:	Added means to call a user-supplied "page consumed"
			function, added means to set the pad page to
			a user-specified silence (i.e. the ^ or # phone),
			and changed the controlRate variable to a float, to
			allow fractional control rates.

February 26th, 1995:	Added support for the MultiSound DSP card on Intel
			hardware.  The module now compiles "FAT".

November 17th, 1994:	Added a high/low output sample rate choice (settable
			as an utterance-rate parameter).  This allows output
			at either 22050 or 44100 Hz.  Tube lengths of under
			approximately 15.5 cm can now be synthesized.  This
			was not possible before since the sample rate
			conversion algorithm can only upsample in the present
			implementation.  The conversion algorithm should be
			expanded to allow downsampling, and thus allow short
			tube lengths to be synthesized at 22050 Hz.

November 1st, 1994:	Fixed a bug which occurred when loading utterance-rate
			parameters:  r3 was not getting initialized (r4 was
			mistakenly getting initialized instead), with the 
			result that the nasal parameters were being loaded
			to the wrong (and indeterminate!) place.

October 20th, 1994:	Adjusted the output volume upwards, and made 1 channel
			output the same as stereo output with the balance
			at 0.0.

October 20th, 1994:	Changed nose and mouth aperture filter coefficients,
			so now specified as Hz values (which scale
			appropriately as the tube length changes), rather
			than arbitrary coefficient values (which don't scale).

October 2nd, 1994:	Optimized calculation of crossmix, by moving most 
			calculations to the outer loop.  Also permanently
			added linear interpolation to glottal volume.  Added
			(optional) linear interpolation to all variable
			scattering junctions.  Reversed r3 and r4 in update
			routines, to optimize the interpolation.

September 19th, 1994:	Resectioned the TRM to have 10 sections in 8 regions.
			Also changed frication injection to be continuous from
			sections 3 to 10.  Lengths down to 15.8 cm are
			possible, with everything enabled.

September 13th, 1994:	Fixed bug that caused the frication bandwidth control
			not to work.  Since the dsp loader does not load the
			betaTable into off-chip memory, it is created in low
			memory, and transferred to off-chip memory in the
			reset routine.

September 6th, 1994:	Optimized DSP code so that tube lengths down to 12.4
			cm are now possible.  Some C code was changed to help
			the optimizations.  Changes were made to memory
			management so that adding more sections to the tube
			will be easy.

May 20th, 1994:		Copied version 8 (tag v8) of the synthesizer_module
			to use as a base of development for the new TRM
			synthesizer module.  Version 8 is the latest version
			of the synthesizer_module, and is used in the
			production version of the 1.07 TextToSpeech Kits.
			The revision information in all the source code
			has been reinitialized, since a new code tree is
			being started.
